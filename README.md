🌟 Project Overview

This project is an exploration into game logic and state management using the Scratch engine. It reimagines the classic Pokémon battle system by introducing a unique "Alien Language Translator" mechanic. Instead of simple turn-based combat, the player must decode encrypted commands to successfully execute attacks.

This simulation focuses on the interaction between user inputs, sprite animation states, and variable management to create a seamless battle experience.

🎮 The "Alien Translator" Mechanic
The core innovation of this project is the command decoding system.

The Challenge: When a player selects an attack, they are not immediately successful.


The Logic: The user must decode an "alien language" command into English.

The Outcome:

Success: The Pokémon executes the move (e.g., Water Shuriken).


Failure: The attack is "Missed," providing immediate feedback on the logic failure.

⚔️ Combat & Abilities

The project features custom animations and hit-detection for specific moves. The sprites communicate via broadcast messages (e.g., CHARIZARD ATTACK or END ATTACK) to synchronize damage and animations.



Water Shuriken: A multi-hit projectile attack.


Hydro Pump: A high-power water blast.


Flamethrower: Charizard's signature fire move.


Cut: A close-range physical strike.


🖥️ User Interface (UI) Design
To enhance the "game feel," custom UI elements were created to track battle status:


Battle HUD: A dedicated control panel for selecting moves.


Dynamic Health Bars: Visual representations (Game Bars) for both Greninja and Charizard that update based on damage received.

🌌 Environment
The battle takes place in a custom Sci-Fi Theme background, moving away from traditional arenas to a space-station setting, emphasizing the futuristic/alien theme of the project.
